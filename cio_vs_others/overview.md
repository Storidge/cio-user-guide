# Overview

Storidge's CIO is not the only way to manage persistent storage for containerized applications.

As computing technology has evolved, we as an industry have developed interesting technologies and approaches to solving the problem of application data management and protection. This section compares CIO to alternative ways of provisioning and managing storage in orchestrated environments.

Due to the bias of comparisons, we will attempt to stay with facts. If you find something that is incorrect or out of date, please [open an issue](https://storidge.com/support/) so we can address it.
