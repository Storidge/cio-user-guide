<h1>Get Started with CIO</h1>
---
Storage has a reputation as technology that is difficult to use, and requires expertise to operate. Our goal is to deliver enterprise storage that any one can deploy and use. Storidge's Container I/O (CIO) software is focused on simplifying the life of developers and operators.

This [Introduction](https://guide.storidge.com/what_is_cio/introduction.html) identifies key capabilities and benefits of the CIO software.

The [Getting Started](https://guide.storidge.com/getting_started/install.html) section steps through software installation, creation of a cluster, and highlights commonly used commands and important use cases.

CIO is cloud native storage. However cloud native storage is not the only way to provide persistent storage for stateful cloud native applications. The [CIO vs Others](https://guide.storidge.com/cio_vs_others/overview.html) section discusses how earlier generations of storage technology can work with cloud native apps in an orchestrated environment. It identifies important factors for enterprises to consider, as they journey towards a more software defined future for their data centers.
