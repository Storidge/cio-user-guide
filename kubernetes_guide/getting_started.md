<h1>Getting Started</h1>

Welcome! We are excited that you want to learn more about persistent storage for Kubernetes. This guide provides steps for getting started with Storidge and stateful applications on Kubernetes. 

Storidge was built on the idea that operating storage for stateful applications should be really simple. We take a developer-centric approach for cloud native storage so you can focus on applications instead of worrying about infrastructure dependencies.

Step through this guide to see how automating storage operations greatly simplifies the way container storage and cloud native apps work together.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

A convenience script installs the community edition of cio software into your development environments quickly and non-interactively. The use of convenience scripts is recommended for dev environments only, as root permissions are required to run them. This script will detect your Linux distribution and version, and install all dependencies and suggestions of the package manager without asking for confirmation.

Storidge's cio software currently supports CentOS 7 (3.10 kernel), RHEL 7 (3.10 kernel), Ubuntu 18.04LTS (4.15 kernel), and Ubuntu 20.04LTS (5.4 kernel).
