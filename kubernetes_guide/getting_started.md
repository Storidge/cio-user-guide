<h1>Getting Started</h1>

Welcome! We are excited that you want to learn more about persistent storage for Kubernetes. This guide provides steps for getting started with Storidge and stateful applications on Kubernetes. 

Storidge was built on the idea that operating storage for stateful applications should be really simple. We take a developer-centric approach for cloud native storage so you can focus on applications instead of worrying about infrastructure dependencies.

Step through this guide to see how automating storage operations greatly simplifies the way container storage and cloud native apps work together.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

The minimum supported size for a Storidge cluster is three nodes. For evaluation purposes, a single node cluster can be configured.  

Each node must include three data drives to ensure data redundancy. Please refer to [prerequisites](https://docs.storidge.com/prerequisites/hardware.html) for additional details. 

Storidge currently supports CentOS 7 (3.10 kernel), RHEL 7 (3.10 kernel), Ubuntu 18.04LTS (4.15 kernel), and Ubuntu 20.04LTS (5.4 kernel).
